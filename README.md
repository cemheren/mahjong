# mahjong
Open source multiplayer mahjong game. Hosted with Azure @ http://mahjonglab.com

Multiplayer mahjong game implemented with colyseus engine. 

Automatically creates a room when you go to the main page as you the first player, share the room id to play with others. 

# What's supported: 

The game doesn't have any enforcement on the rules at the moment. So you can pull a tile from the wall at any time including when it's not your turn. 
I intentionally left this part out since 
  a) the turn rules are complicated in Mahjong
  b) different styles can have different rules
  
Other game mechanics like pulling from middle or the wall are supported. You can select tiles and create a Pung, Chow etc. 

Scoring is left to the players as many people play with simplified scoring.
