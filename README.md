# mahjong
Open source multiplayer mahjong game. Hosted with Azure @ http://mahjonglab.com

Multiplayer mahjong game implemented with colyseus engine. 

Automatically creates a room when you go to the main page as you the first player, share the room id to play with others. 

#What's supported: 

The game doesn't have any enforcement on the rules at the moment. So you can pull a tile from the wall at any time including when it's not your turn. 
I intentionally left this part out since 
  a) the turn rules are complicated in Mahjong
  b) different styles can have different rules
